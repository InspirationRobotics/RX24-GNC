        The heartbeat format can be found in the Team Handbook V3 Appendix D (Page 55).
        The heartbeat must specify all relevant information about the mission BESIDES the following:
         - Date
         - Time
         - Team ID
         - Checksum
        It must return a list of the required information in the correct order.
        For example, Scan the Code would be: 
        heartbeat = ["$RXCOD", self.light_pattern]

        heartbeat = []
        return heartbeat

        Camera data is a dictionary with the following format:
        {
            "port": CameraData,
            "starboard": CameraData,
            "center": CameraData
        }
        CameraData is a class that contains the image frame and the results of a Yolo model (if running).
        And can be accessed like so:
            camera_data.frame
            camera_data.results

        PositionData is a class that contains the current position and heading of the vehicle.
        And can be accessed like so:
            position_data.lat : float
            position_data.lon : float
            position_data.position : tuple (lat, lon)
            position_data.heading : float

        The output perc_cmd has the following format (does not have to be filled):
        You only need to put any arguements in here if you want to change the current perception config.
        {
            "start": ["camera_name"],
            "stop": ["camera_name"],
            "record": ["camera_name"],
            "stop_record": ["camera_name"],
            "load_model": [("camera_name", "model_path")],
            "stop_model": ["camera_name"]
        }

        The output gnc_cmd has the following format (does not have to be filled):
        {
            "heading": float, # The target heading for the boat to turn towards
            "vector": tuple, # The target vector for the boat to head towards (will override heading)
            "poshold": bool, # Whether to set the GNC to poshold mode (heading is not maintained but position is)
            "waypoint": tuple, # The target waypoint to set the GNC to (sending any other commands will override this)
            "end_mission": bool # Whether to end the mission
        }

        You can log/print data by using the self.log() function inherited from the Logger class.
        It is f-string compatible so you can call it like so:
            self.log(f"Position: {position_data.position}")
            or just self.log("hi there") or self.log(variable)

        Any cleanup code can be placed here.
        This function is called when the run function returns end_mission = True 
        or when the mission handler decides to end the mission.
